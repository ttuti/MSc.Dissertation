#### Introduction

>This project is a syndicated R application built to generate analysis ready datasets for the child survey data of Demographic and Health Survey (DHS).

>This comprises a set of R scripts run sequentially to generate a combined dataset of the DHS 2014 Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana and Senegal data and DHS 2013 data from Namibia for 6-23 month old children. Each country has an equal weight in the pooled sample.
